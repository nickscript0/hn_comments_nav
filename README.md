# hn_comments_nav

## TODOs
- [ ] Apr 1, 2017 :date: New feature: allow multi-keyword highlight each with a unique colour (e.g. I want to highlight someone else's name throughout or specific words)
- [ ] Currently when advancing same level comments, it stops if end of root, instead could advance to next element (as RES does)
- [ ] Add key when held down overlays parent comment, so you can see the context of the current comment you're reading
- [ ] Add stats for the current comment (number of children, others?)
- [ ] Fix: should disable shortcut keys when user is inputting text in a textbox
- [x] Highlight OP's name
